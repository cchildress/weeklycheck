weekly check provides the following output:
1) Uptime
2) Current CPU usage
3) Current memory usage
4) Disk usage
5) Disk SMART status
6) Temperature readings from sensorsd
7) Gentoo portage updates available
8) List of GLSAs that affect the system
9) Current running kernel version
10) Time until a list of SSL certs expire

The script can be scheduled in cron to provide you a nice summary once a week (or more often if you want).
Right now it really only works in Gentoo, but you could probably tweak the updates function to parse a different package manager. You'll probably need to remove the GLSA check entirely.

The SMART, sensors, and SSL outputs can be enabled or disabled via /etc/weeklycheck/config
This config file is based on the ini file format.
Currently the following options are supported:
[modules]
enable_ssl = 1
enable_smart = 1
enable_sensors = 1

The list of certs is still specified in /etc/weeklycheck/ssl_certs. I'm going to move this over to the main config file eventually.
